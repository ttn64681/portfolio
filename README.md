This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About

This is my personal website and portfolio for Computer Science related jobs. It is sort of my dream passion to incorporate my passion for art, music, programming, and games into one. All art and music is made by me!

## Vision

I want this to be of a pixel-video-game inspired theme.
