=== DESIGN PHILOSOPHY & CAREER GOALS

Thai is seeking roles in Software Engineering, AI Infrastructure, Cloud Engineering, and Full-Stack Development. He follows a "full-cycle" engineering philosophy, believing that high-performance backend systems must be paired with intuitive, high-fidelity UI/UX. He leverages his background in digital art (Aseprite, Blender) to create unique, polish-focused user experiences that distinguish his software from standard enterprise solutions.
