SPLASH LAYERS:
- Layer 1 (black): 2 frames, 1100x153, slow rate (one frame every 6 frames of others).
- Layers 2-5 (water, midland, buildings, sky): 25 frames each, 2200px per frame, 2.5s steps(24).

PROFILE SPRITES:
- portrait + portrait-glasses have 191 frames, spritesheet = 13561x73.
- potrait-glasses-only also has 191 frames. Plays when portrait is clicked (overlayed over original). 
Trimmed 21px off bottom, 41px off top, so spritesheet is 13561x11.

- tiles (underneath portraits) have 32 frames, but trimmed 1px off bottom, 33px off top, 
so spritesheet is 2272x48

- portrait-talking + portrait-talking-glasses have 48 frames, but only plays when dialogue button is clicked, 
the spritesheet is 3408x73.
- portrait-talking-glasses-only also has 48 frames, but gets overlayed over portrait instead of replacing it with 
portrait-talking-glasses. Trimmed 21px off bottom, 41px off top, so spritesheet is 3408x11.

CHAT SPRITES:
pfps = 23x23px
bubble-me (tail-facing left) = 10x13
bubble-you (tail-facing right) = 10x13
To split the bubble into 9-slices for dynamic text-sizing:
- top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corner is 3x3
- left-middle and right-middle portion is 3x7
- top-middle and bottom-middle portion is 4x3

PROJECT CARD BUTTON SPRITES (shown when hovering link-walk, overlayed underneath link at bottom) (4 frames):
- link-walk (back of project cards, at bottom left under bullet points) = 18x25/frame, sprite sheet 72x25
- octocat-float (back of project cards, right next to link-walk) = 17x23/frame, sprite sheet 68x23

CSS steps() for N-frame sprite animation (avoid wrong/uneven animation or "loops too early"):
- Keyframe range must be the FULL sheet width (0 to -(N × frameWidth)), not (N-1) frame widths.
- Use steps(N, end) so each step lands on a frame boundary (0, -frameW, -2×frameW, ...).
- If you use range 0 to -(N-1)×frameW with steps(N), the browser interpolates between frames → uneven. With steps(N-1) the last frame only flashes at 100% → loops too early.

PROJECT PAGE SPRITES:
- link-walk-shadow = 16x4/frame, sprite sheet 64x4
- octocat-float-shadow = 15x5/frame, sprite sheet 60x5
